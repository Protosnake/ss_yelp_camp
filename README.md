# ss_yelp_camp
This is my implementation of final project of Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele

In this project we used Node and Express for backend, Mongo for DB, Bootstrap for styling and native JS.

# installation
Pre-requisites: npm > 5.6.0 and node > 8.x
1. Run `npm install` in root directory
2. Start mongoDB by running `./mongod`. Change `dbpath` variable if you want to store DB outside of your root folder
3. Make a request to `http://localhost:3000`

This is a basic implementation of forum like web application, including following features:

- Basic authentication
- Observing all of the camps submitted by community
- Submiting new camps
- Commenting on camps
- Editing and deleting camps
